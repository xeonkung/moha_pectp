The files contained in this directory are the timetabling library files for 
the implementation of the first phase, with a crossover and mutation function 
added to the Solution class, plus a main file ga.cpp implementing a basic 
version of EA. The Makefile creates an executable file timetabling.ga.uk.1. 
This has to be run with the parameters -i [instance name] -t [total time] 
-p [type of instance]. The parameter -p (1, 2, and 3 respectively for the easy, 
medium and hard instances) sets the parameter maxSteps for the local search to 
200, 1000, and 2000 respectively.
A brief description of the EA follows.

Evolutionary algorithm implemented for the Metaheuristics Network 
first phase on Timetabling:

Steady-state GA. Population size 10. Tournament selection 
with tornament of size 5. Replace worst replacement policy. Crossover 
rate 0.8. Uniform crossover. Mutation is a random move and it is applied 
with probability 0.5. Local search at each generation makes it a Lamarckian 
GA or a memetic algorithm. No other problem specific knowledge or heuristic 
used.
